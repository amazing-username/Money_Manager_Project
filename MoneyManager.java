 * Purpose: To create an application to manage money
 * in different psuedo-accounts that are actually from
 * a single account. Lets say I have a checking account
 * with $500,000 and I have ten accounts. To keep a 
 * record of the transactions from all those accounts
 * I have to log everything down but with an application,
 * I just have to add data and the data can be saved to
 * prevent data lost, opposed to writing down to a ledger.
