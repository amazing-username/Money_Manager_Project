Money Manager Application - Pre-release development

Disclaimer:
functional but not complete
GUI Design is crude, bland and untasteful... Or just minimalistic
I'm developing this for personal use but it can be applicable for others


This application's purpose is to manage money.

The user enters their paycheck (after taxes) and deductions(either a fixed amount or a
percentage of the paycheck) and it calculates how much money goes into certain accounts.
You are able to display transaction of your accounts. An sql file is included to demo
the application, the database name must be moneydatabase in order for it to work.
You will not be able to recover the database if the names are different.

Also, the username should be mmp and the password should be rootofallevil. The user
mmp should be given permissions to mySQL functions.


Required:
MySQL or MariaDB
Java 1.8
