Money Manager Application

Disclaimer:
functional but not complete
GUI Design is crude, bland and untasteful... Or just minimalistic
I'm developing this for personal use but it can be applicable for others


This application's purpose is to manage money.

The user enters a their paycheck (after taxes) and deductions(either a fixed amount or a
percentage of the paycheck) and it calculates how much money goes into certain accounts.
There are ten accounts total and the percentages of those accounts are fixed but are
changeable when the program is ran but after the program closes the percentages will
revert to their original amounts.

The ten accounts are listed as followed:
iPhone Account(Technology related)
Personal Emergency Account
Family Emergency Account
Car Account
Investing Account
Clothing Account
Supplements Account
Chess Set Account (Entertainment related)
Running Account
Miscellaneous Account
